**Kipon** is an Android application developed as the final project for the DAM superior grade.  
The idea emerged from a personal need: to save money collaboratively between more than two people ‚Äî whether for personal goals (such as trips, gifts, or events) or professional ones (like funding a startup or a joint project)..

Although there are solutions for individual saving or shared expense management, Kipon focuses on creating **shared savings jars**, simplifying group financial organization and promoting transparency.

This repository corresponds to a **first functional prototype** of the application, developed with the aim of validating the idea, testing technical feasibility, and laying the groundwork for future, more complete versions.

The app is developed in `Kotlin` using `Jetpack Compose`, `Material Design`, a `Clean Architecture` structure with an `MVVM` presentation model, and libraries compatible with `KMP` (Kotlin Multiplatform).

## Technologies and Libraries

- **Jetpack Compose**:  Modern Android UI toolkit for building declarative interfaces quickly and efficiently.
- **ViewModel**: Manages and retains UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata?hl=es-419#create_livedata_objects)**: Observes data and allows the UI to automatically react to changes.
- **[Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation?hl=es-419)**: Enables navigation between screens.
- **[Ktor](https://ktor.io/docs/client-create-multiplatform-application.html)**: Multiplatform HTTP client for consuming REST APIs.
- **[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/docs/reference/koin-mp/kmp/)**: Lightweight dependency injection framework with multiplatform support.
- **[Kotlin serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization)**: Reflection-free, multiplatform, and multi-format serialization.
- **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)**: Simplifies asynchronous and concurrent programming, allowing for non-blocking operations like network or database calls.

## Architecture

- **Clean Architecture** with **MVVM (Model - ViewModel - View)** presentation model:
  The project is structured following Clean Architecture principles to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability. Business logic is decoupled from presentation logic, enabling a modular and responsibility-focused development.

### Data Layer
- **API**: Data fetched from a REST API using Ktor.
- **Repositories**: Interfaces that define data access operations, implemented to interact with the REST API and local database.

### Domain Layer
- **Bussiness Logic**: Implementation of use cases required to carry out the developed features.

### Presentation Layer
- **ViewModels**: Classes that handle UI logic and expose data to the UI using LiveData.
- **Composables**: Declarative UI components built with Jetpack Compose that represent views and react to data changes.
- **Screens**: App screens that use composables to display information to the user.

## REST API
The app uses a custom REST API developed in Java with Spring, and integrates with `AWS services`.
